     == Introduction ==
     
     This directory contains Applescript code for manipulating stuff in my
     Evernote account. There is a python program that uses the Evernote
     OAUTH mechanism for accessing Evernote online, but that turned out to
     be less useful than expected (see "Reasons to prefer Applescript over
     Python" below).

     == Contents ==

     add-tags:
         Assign a (set of) tags to a (set of) notes

     count-notes:
         Count the Evernote notes that match a given query string

     create-note:
         Create a new note based on the command line args

     === Reasons to prefer Applescript over Python ===

      * Applescript carries out Evernote interactions directly on the local
        machine and doesn't need to be authenticated.

      * Applescript is not subject to the bandwidth limits Evernote imposes
        on online applications.

      * Python interactions require internet access. Applescript
        interactions do not.
