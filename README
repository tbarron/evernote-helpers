     == Introduction ==

     This directory contains Applescript code for manipulating stuff in my
     Evernote account. There is a python program that uses the Evernote
     OAUTH mechanism for accessing Evernote online, but that turned out to
     be less useful than expected (see "Reasons to prefer Applescript over
     Python" below).

     === Reasons to prefer Applescript over Python ===

      * Applescript carries out Evernote interactions directly on the local
        machine and doesn't need to be authenticated.

      * Applescript is not subject to the bandwidth limits Evernote imposes
        on online applications.

      * Python interactions require internet access. Applescript
        interactions do not.
