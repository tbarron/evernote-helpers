     == Introduction ==
     
     This directory contains Applescript code for manipulating stuff in my
     Evernote account. There is a python program that uses the Evernote
     OAUTH mechanism for accessing Evernote online, but that turned out to
     be less useful than expected (see "Reasons to prefer Applescript over
     Python" below).

     == Functions ==

     add-tags

     count-notes

     create-note

     daily-twiddle

     del-notes

     dialog

     library

     make-date

     make-next-week

     note-exists

     rm-tags

     show-notes

     test_osa.py

     == The Python Experiment ==
     
     etool.py

     === Reasons to prefer Applescript over Python ===

      * Applescript carries out Evernote interactions directly on the local
        machine and doesn't need to be authenticated.

      * Applescript is not subject to the bandwidth limits Evernote imposes
        on online applications.

      * Python interactions require internet access. Applescript
        interactions do not.
